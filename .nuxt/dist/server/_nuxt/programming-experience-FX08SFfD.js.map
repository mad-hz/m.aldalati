Laravel's elegant syntax and powerful features, such as Eloquent ORM and\n                        Blade templating, make it easy to build robust and scalable applications. I've also integrated\n                        MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, ensuring data is handled efficiently. In addition to Laravel,\n                        I've worked with Vue.js and Nuxt.js to build dynamic front-ends, enhancing the user experience.\n                        TailwindCSS and Bootstrap are my go-to tools for crafting responsive and visually appealing\n                        designs.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <figure>\n                    <img class=\"w-full object-cover rounded-xl\" src=\"~/assets/images/blog/programming.png\"\n                        alt=\"Programming Experience\">\n                    <figcaption class=\"mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-neutral-500\">\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p class=\"text-lg text-gray-800\">Beyond coding, I've managed deployments using cPanel, ensuring smooth\n                    website management, and I've configured email services with Roundcube. This hands-on experience\n                    across various tools and technologies has deepened my understanding of full-stack development,\n                    enabling me to build comprehensive, efficient web applications.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script setup>\nconst config = useRuntimeConfig()\n\nuseHead({\n    title: `Programming Experience - ${config.public.appName}`\n})\n</script>"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAmCA,UAAM,SAAS,iBAAkB;AAEjC,YAAQ;AAAA,MACJ,OAAO,4BAA4B,OAAO,OAAO,OAAO;AAAA,IAC5D,CAAC;;;;;;;;;;;;"}
