Laravel&#39;s elegant syntax and powerful features, such as Eloquent ORM and Blade templating, make it easy to build robust and scalable applications. I&#39;ve also integrated MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, ensuring data is handled efficiently. In addition to Laravel, I&#39;ve worked with Vue.js and Nuxt.js to build dynamic front-ends, enhancing the user experience. TailwindCSS and Bootstrap are my go-to tools for crafting responsive and visually appealing designs.</p></div><figure><img class="w-full object-cover rounded-xl" src="'+o+'" alt="Programming Experience"><figcaption class="mt-3 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 dark:text-neutral-500"></figcaption></figure><p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Beyond coding, I&#39;ve managed deployments using cPanel, ensuring smooth website management, and I&#39;ve configured email services with Roundcube.
